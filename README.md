Loudcloud
=====================================

If you want to run this software locally, you will need these:

1. [Playframework 2.1](http://www.playframework.com/download "Play")
2. [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads "MongoDB") (and a database called "loudcloud")

Then for the integration with SoundCloud:

1. Register at [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com "SoundCloud") if you have no account yet
2. Register your app at http://developers.soundcloud.com/
3. Create a new file `conf/secrets.conf` (you can make a copy of `conf/secrets.conf.default`) and paste your sound cloud client_id there

If you want to see it online: http://www.loud.finpack.pl

Have fun!
