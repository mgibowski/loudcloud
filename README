Loudcloud
=====================================

If you want to run this software locally, you will need these:

1. JDK and Playframework 2.0
2. MongoDB

Then for the integration with SoundCloud:
1. Register at soundcloud.com if you have no account yet
2. Register your app at http://developers.soundcloud.com/
3. Create a new file conf/secrets.conf (you can make a copy of conf/secrets.conf.default) and paste your sound cloud client_id there

If you want to see it online: http://www.loud.finpack.pl

Have fun!
